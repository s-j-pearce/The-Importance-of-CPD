# The-Importance-of-CPD

## What is CPD?
CPD stands for continuing professional development. Continuing professional development is where a person will continue to update or improve their skills even after initial training. A perfect example of CPD is where someone takes an online course to further their understanding of something wether it is a hobby or maybe something that they feel they might need or require in the future. All training and learning after initial training can go on your portfolio to show you are dedicated and experienced.

Companies and businesses are constantly evolving and expanding so it is imperative to keep up to date with new and alternate ways of working.
