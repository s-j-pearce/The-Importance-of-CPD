# The-Importance-of-CPD

## What is CPD?
CPD stands for continuing professional development. Continuing professional development is where a person will continue to update or improve their skills even after initial training. A perfect example of CPD is where someone takes an online course to further their understanding of something wether it is a hobby or maybe something that they feel they might need or require in the future.
